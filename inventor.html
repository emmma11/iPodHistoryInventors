  <h2>About the Inventors</h2>
  <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
  <h4>Personal Life</h4>
  <p>When Steve Jobs was a baby, he was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs after being put up for adoption by his biological parents.
  He wasn't able to uncover information until he was 27 years of age. Steve was always an intelligent and innovative thinker - even
    from a young age. He tested so well that the school administrators wanted to bump him up to high school; however, his parents 
    declined. When he was older, he enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but he didn't have a direction so he dropped out after 
  six months.</p>
  <h4>Apple</h4>
  <p> Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak in 1971 when he was still in high school.

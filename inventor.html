  <h4>Personal Life</h4>
  <p>When Steve Jobs was a baby, he was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs after being put up for adoption by his biological parents.
  He wasn't able to uncover information until he was 27 years of age. Steve was always an intelligent and innovative thinker - even
    from a young age. He tested so well that the school administrators wanted to bump him up to high school; however, his parents 
    declined. When he was older, he enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but he didn't have a direction so he dropped out after 
  six months.</p>
  <h4>Apple</h4>
  <p> Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak in 1971 when he was still in high school. He was only twenty one 
    years old. However, he was phased out and left the company in 1985. In following years, Jobs 
    bought an animation company from George Lucas. This animation company later became Pixar Animation 
    Studios. Steve invested 50 million dollars from his own money into the company. Pixar eventually merged with 
    Walt Disney in 2006 which made Steve Jovs Disney's largest shareholder. Jobs returned to apple as
    the CEO in 1997.
  </p>
  <h4>Death</h4>
  <p> Steve Jobs found out he has a neuroendocrine tumour in 2003 which is rare, but doctors were able
  to operate. Steve avoided surgery for nine months after finding out. During those nine months, 
  he altered his peso-vegetarian diet and weighed Eastern treatment options. In 2004, Steve finally 
  decided to have the surgery and it was successful; however, his health problems returned in 2009 which 
  included him needing a liver transplant. He eventually died at the age of 56 on October 5, 2011.</p>
